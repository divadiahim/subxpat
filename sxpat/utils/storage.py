class LiveStorage:
    """
        Represents a live storage on which data can be staged and then committed.  
        The class uses a stack to store staged data,
        the first stage after a commit pops all data above the staged key.

        The class has guards to prevent restaging data without committing or staging out of order
        (a key cannot be added before others that appeared sooner in previous staging sequences).
        A commit with missing keys (actually missing, not implicitly copied from the previous iteration) is **valid**.

        If a save happens and then a new key is committed, the next save will update the file with the new key (header and older rows).

        This class can be used with a context manager and will automatically save on exit.
